# Radio-Sim
Hastily built model for wireless communications.

Main features:
 - QPSK or BPSK transmission
 - Customizable (slow fading) channel
 - Multipathing + LMMSE Equalization
 - (7,4) Hamming Error Correcting Code

Next up:
 - Better equalizer spacing 
 - More linear modulation constellations
 - Decision feedback equalizer
 - Different Hamming rates
 - Encryption

Long-term goals:
 - OFDM
 - MIMO
 - More interesting channels
 - Re-make with class structure for increased ease of use

Even Longer-term goals:
 - Verilog or C/C++ implementation of functions for real-life use
